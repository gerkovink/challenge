    "text": "Introduction\nIn this challenge, you will have to synthesize data. In real life, you always have to synthetic data with one of the following two goals in mind:\n\nGetting as close as possible to the original data.\nGetting as close as possible to the inference of a model you estimate in the original data.\n\nFor synthetizing (or is it synthesize?) the data, we suggest you use the R package mice (van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn 2011). While mice was originally developed to impute missing data, but it can also be used to impute synthetic data (see Volker and Vink 2021). Other alternatives to create synthetic data are, for example, the R-package synthpop (Nowok, Raab, and Dibben 2016), or the stand-alone software IVEware (“IVEware: Imputation and Variance Estimation Software,” n.d.).\n\n\nData\nYou will be using the Heart failure clinical records data set, a medical data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. You can find more info about the data and download it here, and download it directly here. The data set contains medical information of 299 individuals on 13 variables, and is typically used to predict whether or not a patient will survive during the follow-up period, using several biomedical. We strongly recommend you create an R project, and store the data in a folder called ‘data’. predictors.\n\n\nCode\nWe will be using the following libraries. If you haven’t installed them yet, you can install them using install.packages(\"desired-library\").\n\nlibrary(mice)     # for imputation and synthesis\nlibrary(magrittr) # for pipes\nlibrary(readr)    # for reading in data\n# add more libraries\n\nYou can read in the data as follows:\n\nheart_failure &lt;- \n  url(\"https://www.gerkovink.com/challenge/practicals/data/heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv\") %&gt;% read_csv()\n\nThe Heart failure clinical records data consists of the following variables:\n\nage: Age in years\nanaemia: Whether the patient has a decrease of red blood cells (No/Yes)\ncreatinine_phosphokinase: Level of the creatinine phosphokinase enzyme in the blood (mcg/L)\ndiabetes: Whether the patient has diabetes (No/Yes)\nhigh_blood_pressure: Whether the patient has high blood pressure (No/Yes)\nejection_fraction: Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction\nplatelets: Platelets in de blood (kiloplatelets/mL)\nsex: Sex (Female/Male)\nserum_creatinine: Level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL)\nserum_sodium: Level of serum sodium in the blood (mg/dL)\nsmoking: Whether the patient smokes (No/Yes)\nfollow_up: Follow-up period (days)\nDEATH_EVENT: Whether the patient was deceased during the follow-up period\n\nAfter loading the data, it is always wise to first inspect the data, so that you have an idea what to expect.\n\nhead(heart_failure)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 13\n    age anaemia creatinine_phosphokinase diabetes ejection_fraction\n  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;                    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    75       0                      582        0                20\n2    55       0                     7861        0                38\n3    65       0                      146        0                20\n4    50       1                      111        0                20\n5    65       1                      160        1                20\n6    90       1                       47        0                40\n# ℹ 8 more variables: high_blood_pressure &lt;dbl&gt;, platelets &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   serum_creatinine &lt;dbl&gt;, serum_sodium &lt;dbl&gt;, sex &lt;dbl&gt;, smoking &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   time &lt;dbl&gt;, DEATH_EVENT &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\nsummary(heart_failure)\n\n      age           anaemia       creatinine_phosphokinase    diabetes     \n Min.   :40.00   Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :  23.0           Min.   :0.0000  \n 1st Qu.:51.00   1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.: 116.5           1st Qu.:0.0000  \n Median :60.00   Median :0.0000   Median : 250.0           Median :0.0000  \n Mean   :60.83   Mean   :0.4314   Mean   : 581.8           Mean   :0.4181  \n 3rd Qu.:70.00   3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.: 582.0           3rd Qu.:1.0000  \n Max.   :95.00   Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :7861.0           Max.   :1.0000  \n ejection_fraction high_blood_pressure   platelets      serum_creatinine\n Min.   :14.00     Min.   :0.0000      Min.   : 25100   Min.   :0.500   \n 1st Qu.:30.00     1st Qu.:0.0000      1st Qu.:212500   1st Qu.:0.900   \n Median :38.00     Median :0.0000      Median :262000   Median :1.100   \n Mean   :38.08     Mean   :0.3512      Mean   :263358   Mean   :1.394   \n 3rd Qu.:45.00     3rd Qu.:1.0000      3rd Qu.:303500   3rd Qu.:1.400   \n Max.   :80.00     Max.   :1.0000      Max.   :850000   Max.   :9.400   \n  serum_sodium        sex            smoking            time      \n Min.   :113.0   Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :  4.0  \n 1st Qu.:134.0   1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.: 73.0  \n Median :137.0   Median :1.0000   Median :0.0000   Median :115.0  \n Mean   :136.6   Mean   :0.6488   Mean   :0.3211   Mean   :130.3  \n 3rd Qu.:140.0   3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:203.0  \n Max.   :148.0   Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :285.0  \n  DEATH_EVENT    \n Min.   :0.0000  \n 1st Qu.:0.0000  \n Median :0.0000  \n Mean   :0.3211  \n 3rd Qu.:1.0000  \n Max.   :1.0000  \n\n\nNow, you are ready to got. First, you will have to synthetize the data. Then, you will have to evaluate it with regards to a model of choice, or the original data.\n\n\nCreating synthetic data\nBroadly speaking, two methods for creating synthetic data can be distinguished. The first one is based on parametric imputation models, which assumes that the structure of the data is fixed, and draws synthetic values from a pre-specified probability distribution. That is, after estimating a statistical model, the synthetic data are generated from a probability distribution, without making any further use of the observed data. In general, this procedure is less likely to result in an accidental release of disclosive information. However, these parametric methods are often less capable of capturing the complex nature of real-world data sets.\nThe subtleties of real-world data are often better reproduced with non-parametric imputation models. Using this approach, a non-parametric model is estimated, resulting in a donor pool out of which a single observation per observation and per variable is drawn. These models thus reuse the observed data to serve as synthetic data. Accordingly, much of the values that were in the observed data end up in the synthetic data. However, these observed data are generally combined in unique ways, it is generally not possible to link this information to the original respondents. The non-parametric procedures often yield better inferences, while still being able to prevent disclosure risk (although more research into measures to qualify the remaining risks is required). We will showcase how to generate synthetic data using one such non-parametric method: classification and regression trees (CART).\nNow you have a feeling of what the data looks like, start synthesizing the data with mice. Use this vignette for inspiration\nSome hints:\n\nuse your own seed - only unique scores are competing for the prize!\nuse the make.where and make.method functions to specify the imputation method\nuse the complete function to extract a single synthetic data from the mids object or calculate the below evaluation measures over all the imputations (extra points)\nalternatively, you can use the syn() function from the synthpop package to generate synthetic data\nplay around with the synthesis method and the number of imputations or iterations to see how the evaluation measures change\ngood luck!\n\n\n\nEvaluating Synthetic data\nOnce you have synthetized your data, you have to evaluate it. If you have chosen to evaluate it with regards to the original data, you will have to perform evaluations such as: comparing univariate distributions, multivariate distributions, and more.\nIf you have chosen to evaluate it with regards to a model, you will have to 1) estimate a model on the original data; and 2) estimate a model on the synthetic data. Then, you will have to compare the results of the two models.\nNote that, in both cases, methods are iterative: you synthetize data, evaluate it, and then go back to synthetizing data. You should do this until the results are as close as desired.\nUse the below code block to calculate the desired metrics for evaluating the synthetic data.\n\nPerformance metrics\n\n# 1. Mean absolute value of mean scaled deviation between original and synthesized variables\nsd &lt;- apply(heart_failure, 2, sd)\nMSD &lt;- colMeans(abs((syn_data-heart_failure)/sd)) |&gt; mean()\n\n# 2. Average deviation of original and synthetic correlation matrix\nMDC &lt;- mean(cor(heart_failure) - cor(syn_data))\n# 2.1 Average absolute deviation of original and synthetic correlation matrix\nMDC_abs &lt;- mean(abs(cor(heart_failure) - cor(syn_data)))\n\n# 3. Pearson divergence according to density ratio package\n# To install, use devtools::install_github(\"thomvolker/densityratio\")\nlibrary(densityratio)\n## Estimate density ratio and check summaries and plots\ndensratio &lt;- ulsif(heart_failure, syn_data) \nPD &lt;- summary(densratio)$PE\n\n# 4.

Net als in de voorgaande cursusdag is het van belang om synthetiseren of imputeren en analyseren hand-in-hand te laten gaan. Deze dag staat daarom wederom in het teken van hands-on leren en samenwerken, met een sterke focus op praktische toepassing en met een statistisch valide randje.\n\n\nDoel\nHet hoofddoel van deze cursusdag is om jou, als trainee, te voorzien van de vaardigheden en kennis die nodig zijn om effectief bij te dragen aan het iteratieve dataontwikkelingsproces binnen multidisciplinaire teams. Door een combinatie van niet te lange verdiepende sessies en duidelijke praktische opdrachten, krijg je de kans om direct toe te passen wat je leert. Dit alles met het oog op het versterken van jouw vaardigheden in het ontwikkelen, testen, en analyseren van methoden op incomplete data sets. We gebruiken daarvoor vandaag het R-package mice, wat geldt als de de facto standaard in het analyseren van incomplete data.\nJe wordt uitgedaagd om je kennis van dark data en computational evaluation te verdiepen. Door middel van een reeks interactieve tutorials en workshops zul je uiteindelijk leren hoe je een eigen imputatiemodel kunt ontwikkelen, toepassen en evalueren. Het programma is zorgvuldig samengesteld om je door deze workflow te leiden, van de eerste kennismaking met simpele data imputatiemethoden tot aan complexe imputatie en data synthese.\nAan het einde van deze dag zul je een sterke basis hebben in de belangrijkste imputatie en syntheseflows en -praktijken die van belang zijn voor elke dark data scientist en zul je de onzekerheid die altijd gepaard gaat met dark data en data synthese op waarde kunnen schatten.\n\n\nVoorbereiding\nDeelnemers dienen het volgende te installeren voorafgaand aan de cursusdag:\nR en RStudio: zie https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nAlternatief: https://posit.cloud\nInstalleer ook alvast het package mice en het package ggmice van CRAN. De package set tidyverse is ook handig.\n\n\nTeaching team\nGerko Vink & Paolo Colussi"

So it is reasonable to assume that the parameters obtained on our sample are biased.\n\nA straightforward and intuitive solution for analyzing incomplete data in such scenarios is multiple imputation (Rubin, 1987).\n\n\nRubin, D.

    "text": "Testing validity\nNowadays many synthetic data cowboys claim that they can generate synthetic data that looks like the real data that served as input.\nThis is like going to Madam Tusseaud’s: at face value it looks identical, but when experienced in real life it’s just not the same as the living thing.\nMany of these synthetic data packages only focus on marginal or conditional distributions. With mice we also consider the inferential properties of the synthetic data.\nIn general, we argue [^4] that any synthetic data generation procedure should\n\nPreserve marginal distributions\nPreserve conditional distribution\nYield valid inference\nYield synthetic data that are indistinguishable from the real data\n\n\nVolker, T.B.; Vink, G.
