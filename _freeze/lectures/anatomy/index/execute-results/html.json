It is often impossible to prove that they hold in practice, but we choose to believe that they do.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n# Sensitivity analyses\nI often use computational evaluation techniques to quantify the scope of the impact of assumptions made. For example, we can test the effect of violating assumptions on our results. We then verify if the inferences are sensitive to violations of the assumptions. We can even verify the extend of when assumptions start becoming influential to our inferences.\n:::\n\n## The holy trinity\nWhenever I evaluate something, I tend to look at three things:\n\n- bias (how far from the truth)\n- uncertainty/variance (how wide is my interval)\n- coverage (how often do I cover the truth with my interval)\n\n<br>\nAs a function of model complexity in specific modeling efforts, these components play a role in the bias/variance tradeoff\n\n<center>\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Bias_and_variance_contributing_to_total_error.svg/2560px-Bias_and_variance_contributing_to_total_error.svg.png){width=40%}\n</center>\n\n## On the individual level\n::::{.columns}\n:::{.column width=\"60%\"}\n![](img/8. prediction_intervals.png){width=\"90%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\nIndividual intervals can also be hugely informative!\n\nIndividual intervals are generally wider than confidence intervals\n\n- This is because it covers inherent uncertainty in the data point on top of sampling uncertainty \n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n# Be careful\nNarrower intervals mean less uncertainty. \n\nIt does not mean that the answer is correct!\n:::\n\n:::\n::::\n\n## Case: Spaceshuttle Challenger\n36 years ago, on 28 January 1986, 73 seconds into its flight and at an altitude of 9 miles, the space shuttle Challenger experienced an enormous fireball caused by one of its two booster rockets and broke up.

So it is reasonable to assume that the parameters obtained on our sample are biased. \n\nA straightforward and intuitive solution for analyzing incomplete data in such scenarios is *multiple imputation* (Rubin, 1987).\n:::\n::::\n\n::: footer \nRubin, D.

Hijmans. 1992. “Validation of Medical History Taking as Part of a Population Based Survey in Subjects Aged 85 and over.” British Medical Journal 304 (6834): 1091–2.\n:::\n\n\n## Problem\n- BP was measured less frequently for very old persons and for persons with health problems. \n- BP was measured more often if the BP was too high, for example if the respondent indicated a previous diagnosis of hypertension, or if the respondent used any medication against hypertension. \n- The missing data rate of BP also varied during the period of data collection. \n  - The rate gradually increases during the first seven months of the sampling period from 5 to 40 percent of the cases, and then suddenly drops to a fairly constant level of 10–15 percent. \n  - A complicating factor here is that the sequence in which the respondents were interviewed was not random. \n  - High-risk groups, that is, elderly in hospitals and nursing homes and those over 95, were visited first.\n\n## Survival rate\n![](img/leiden_km.png)\n\n::: footer\nVan Buuren, S.

Some findings:\n\n- In most groups similar behavioural prevalence was observed. \n- When looking at subgroups, prevalences differ between subgroups.\n- Not applicables were much more prevalent in one group than in other groups\n- There are too few cases and too many patterns with `Not Applicable`'s over features to allow for a pattern-wise analysis (stratified analysis).\n- There are too many `Not Applicables` to allow for *listwise deletion*.\n\n## Some background\nWe know: \n\n1. `Not Applicable` is not randomly distributed over the data. Removing them is therefore not valid!\n2. `Not Applicable` are bonafide missing values: there should be no observations.\n\n::: callout-important\n# There's no such thing as a free lunch\n\nEvery imputation will bias the results. For some we know the direction of the bias, for some we have no idea. We do not have access to the truth.\n:::\n\n### What would you do?\n\n## Our solution\nWe chose to impute the data as `1 (never)`. There are a couple of reasons why we think that this is the best defendable scenario.\n\n1. `Never` has a semantic similarity to a behaviour not being applicable. However,  `Never` implies intentionality; `Not Applicable` does not.\n2. We know the effect the imputation has on the inference: Filling in `Never` will underestimate intentional behaviours. \n\nIn this case the choice was made to make a **deliberate error**. The estimates obtained would serve as an underestimation of *true behaviour* and can be considered a lower bound estimation. \n\n## To conclude\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"790\" height=\"475\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GiPe1OiKQuk?si=JRskAvV-ObldIOfO\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n\n",
